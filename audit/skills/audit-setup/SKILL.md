name: audit-setup
description: One-time setup of the audit plugin in a host repo — installs dependency-cruiser + scc, seeds .audit/audit.config.json with default baselines, takes the first composite-score baseline, and registers a pre-commit hook that blocks regressing commits. Use when the user says "set up audit", "install audit plugin", "configure code audit", "add pre-commit quality gate", "enable audit", or asks to wire the audit plugin into a repo.
when_to_invoke: User asks to install / set up / enable / configure the audit plugin in a repo. Also invoke automatically as part of /audit-init.

# audit-setup

Walk the user (or yourself, when run agentically) through the full one-time setup of the audit plugin in the current host repo.

## Preconditions

- The plugin lives at `<repoRoot>/audit/`. If `audit/scripts/audit.mjs` does not exist, abort: the plugin is not vendored into this repo.
- The current working directory must be inside a git repo (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` succeeds).

## Steps

### 1. Verify Node 18+

Run `node --version`. If missing or < 18, abort with:

> Node 18+ is required. Install from https://nodejs.org/ and re-run /audit-init.

### 2. Install required binaries

The audit scanner needs `dependency-cruiser` and `scc`. Pick the install path that matches the host repo:

- **If `<repoRoot>/package.json` exists**: install dependency-cruiser project-locally:
  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev dependency-cruiser
  ```
  Verify it resolves on PATH via `npx depcruise --version` (the scanner's `which depcruise` check requires it on PATH; if project-local, also expose it via `npm bin` / a wrapper, or fall back to a global install).
- **Otherwise** (or if PATH visibility is needed): install globally:
  ```sh
  npm install -g dependency-cruiser
  ```

For `scc` (Go binary):
- macOS: `brew install scc`
- Linux/macOS w/ Go toolchain: `go install github.com/boyter/scc/v3@latest`
- Manual: download a release from https://github.com/boyter/scc/releases and place on PATH.

Verify both:
```sh
which depcruise && depcruise --version
which scc       && scc --version
```

If either is missing, surface the exact install command for the user's platform and stop.

### 3. Create .audit/ and seed audit.config.json

Create the `.audit/` directory in the repo root and write `audit.config.json`.

**Pick `srcGlobs` per architecture** — the audit MUST scan only the host repo's product code, not vendored tooling, build output, or fixtures. Detect the architecture (look for guardrails skill that was applied, or infer from layout) and use the matching globs:

| Architecture                       | Recommended `srcGlobs`                              |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `node-api`                         | `["src"]`                                           |
| `react-next-vercel-webapp`         | `["app", "components", "lib"]` (drop any missing)   |
| `supabase-api`                     | `["supabase/functions", "types"]`                   |
| `supabase-node-rag`                | `["app", "lib", "types", "supabase/seed"]`          |
| Unknown / other                    | `["src"]` if it exists, else best-guess source root |

Drop any glob whose directory does not exist on disk. If none match, ask the user which folder holds product code rather than falling back to `.`.

```json
{
  "regressionThreshold": 5,
  "requireImprovement": false,
  "srcGlobs": ["src"],
  "baselines": {
    "cycles":        { "good": 0,    "bad": 0.10 },
    "depth":         { "good": 4,    "bad": 15   },
    "roots":         { "good": 0.10, "bad": 0    },
    "avgLoc":        { "good": 100,  "bad": 400  },
    "p90Loc":        { "good": 200,  "bad": 600  },
    "edges":         { "good": 2,    "bad": 10   },
    "orphan":        { "good": 0,    "bad": 0.20 },
    "fan":           { "good": 5,    "bad": 40   },
    "avgComplexity": { "good": 5,    "bad": 25   },
    "maxComplexity": { "good": 10,   "bad": 60   },
    "circularRate":  { "good": 0,    "bad": 0.10 }
  }
}
```

These defaults are tuned for typical TypeScript / Node service repos. If the host repo is a monorepo with very different per-package shapes, the user can hand-tune them later — but DO NOT tune weights (those are hard-coded in the plugin so scores stay comparable across projects).

`srcGlobs` is the per-repo scope knob. The scanner passes it to both `dependency-cruiser` and `scc`, so both architecture and LOC/complexity composites see the same files. If `srcGlobs` is omitted, the scanner falls back to whichever of `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` exist — adequate for a vanilla project, but be explicit for anything else.

### 4. Take the baseline scan

Run from the repo root:

```sh
node audit/scripts/audit.mjs --update
```

This performs a full scan, computes the four composites, and writes `.audit/audit.results.json`. Confirm to the user:

- All four composites (architecture, maintainability, testability, health) printed with non-zero values.
- A `.audit/audit.results.json` file now exists.

### 5. Install the pre-commit hook

```sh
bash audit/scripts/install-hook.sh
```

This is idempotent: re-running updates the audit block in place. If the host repo already has a pre-commit hook (husky, pre-commit framework, custom), the script appends the audit block behind sentinel markers without clobbering existing logic.

### 6. Verify the hook

Stage a no-op change (e.g. `touch .audit/.audit-installed && git add .audit/`) and run the hook directly:

```sh
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Expected: exit 0 with `audit: pass.` line.

### 7. Commit the .audit/ baseline

The `.audit/audit.config.json` AND `.audit/audit.results.json` files MUST be committed to source control so all developers (and CI, if added later) share the same baseline. Add them and commit with a message like:

```
chore(audit): install audit plugin and record baseline
```

The `.git/hooks/pre-commit` itself is local-only and is auto-installed by anyone who runs `bash audit/scripts/install-hook.sh` after clone.

## Notes & flags

- `requireImprovement: true` blocks any commit that does NOT improve scores. Only enable this during an active refactor campaign — leaving it on in steady state will block ordinary feature work.
- Re-baseline after a large intentional refactor with `node audit/scripts/audit.mjs --update` (or `/audit-run`).
- The pre-commit hook is read-only — it never writes the results file. Only `--update` (audit-run / audit-init) writes the baseline.
