# Extend scanner.mjs to capture per-file complexity from scc

## Parent Initiative

[[DGEN-I-0007]]

## Objective

Modify `audit/scripts/lib/scanner.mjs` to invoke scc with the per-file/complexity-emitting flags (e.g. `--by-file --format=json`), parse the per-file `Complexity` field, and reduce into `avgComplexity` (mean) and `maxComplexity` (max) on the returned `ScanMetrics`. Today these fields are 0/absent, so the maintainability composite is missing one of its three intended signals.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scanner returns non-zero `avgComplexity` and `maxComplexity` on this repo
- [ ] Existing scanner outputs (totalLoc, avgLoc, file counts, depcruise-derived fields) are unchanged
- [ ] If the installed scc version doesn't support the needed flags, surface a clear error and document required version (update audit-setup SKILL prereqs if needed)
- [ ] Per-file aggregation only — no per-function work
- [ ] `audit/scripts/lib/scanner.test.mjs` updated for the new fields and passing

## Status Updates

### 2026-05-08 — implementation
- `runScc` now invokes scc with `--by-file --format json .` (bumped maxBuffer to 256MB to absorb the larger payload).
- `reduce()` collects per-file `Complexity` from each language's `Files[]` and computes `avgComplexity = mean`, `maxComplexity = max`. Depcruise per-module complexity remains as a fallback when scc lacks a Complexity signal (preserves the existing fixture-based test, which has no scc Complexity).
- Smoke-run on this repo: `avgComplexity=5.62`, `maxComplexity=139`, `totalLoc=14168` (LOC fields unchanged in shape).
- Tests: existing 3 still pass (fallback path covers depcruise=12 fixture). Added 2 new cases — `prefers scc per-file Complexity` and `falls back to depcruise when scc lacks Complexity`. All 5 pass.
- scc 3.6.0 (homebrew) supports `--by-file` + per-file `Complexity`. No version-prereq doc update needed for the macOS dev path; if other environments pin scc, we can revisit in audit-setup later.
- Per-function aggregation remains out of scope (per task non-goals).
