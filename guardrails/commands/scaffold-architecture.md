description: Copy one of the guard-rails architecture boilerplates (eslint.config.mjs + tsconfig.json) into a target project, with peer-dep install instructions.
argument-hint: <pattern> [target-dir]
---

You are scaffolding a project from the guardrails plugin's architecture catalog.

Pattern requested: `$1`
Target directory: `$2` (default: current working directory)

Steps:

1. Resolve the pattern. Valid values:
   - `react-next-vercel-webapp` (or `next`, `nextjs`, `vercel`)
   - `node-api` (or `node`, `api`)
   - `supabase-api` (or `supabase`)
   - `supabase-node-rag` (or `rag`, `pgvector`, `supabase-rag`)

   If `$1` is empty or unrecognized, list the four options and ask which one. Do not guess.

2. Locate the source. The catalog lives inside this plugin at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/architectures/<pattern>/` (i.e. the guardrails plugin's own `architectures/<pattern>/` directory). Do not look outside the plugin directory.

3. Read the pattern's `README.md` and surface the **Overview**, **When to avoid**, and **Layers** sections so the user confirms it fits.

4. Copy `eslint.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json` from `architectures/<pattern>/` into the target directory. Do NOT overwrite existing files without explicit confirmation — diff first and ask.

5. Print the peer-dependency install command from the pattern README and ask whether to run it.

6. Tell the user what to customize (path globs in `no-restricted-imports`, package name aliases, `paths` in tsconfig).

7. Recommend invoking the matching skill (`arch-next-vercel`, `arch-node-api`, `arch-supabase-api`, or `arch-supabase-node-rag`) for the full rules reference.

8. Invoke the `universal-guard-rails` skill to offer the two architecture-agnostic additions (fail-fast build + pre-commit gate; agent guardrail against lint/type-rule loosening). Ask both questions; apply only what the user accepts.

Be terse. Show diffs before writing. Confirm before any destructive action.
