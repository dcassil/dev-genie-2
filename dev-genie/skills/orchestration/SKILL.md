name: orchestration
description: Canonical, ordered registry of dev-genie sub-plugins. Tells the agent which sub-plugins to install, in what order, how to detect each one is already installed, which setup command to invoke, and how to verify it succeeded. Adding a new sub-plugin = appending one entry to the registry below.

# dev-genie orchestration

dev-genie owns no scoring logic, no scaffolds, and no per-stack rules. Its sole job is to drive marketplace plugin setup in the right order. This skill is the **single source of truth** for that order.

## How to use this skill

When invoked (typically by the `/dev-genie-init` command):

1. Read the `project-detection` skill first to classify the repo as `greenfield` vs `existing` and suggest an architecture.
2. **If `project_kind == existing`**, take the **reconciliation path**:
   a. Invoke `dev-genie/skills/existing-config-detection/SKILL.md` to produce a structured detection report (lint/ts/format/hook/CI/audit-state/agent-configs+locks).
   b. Invoke `dev-genie/skills/reconcile/SKILL.md` (which wraps `lib/compare-config.js` + `lib/apply-flow.js`) to produce the per-finding plan, prompt for lock resolutions, and apply the chosen changes. The CLI entry point is `bin/dev-genie-init.mjs`; it accepts `--dry-run` to preview without writing.
   c. The reconciliation path supersedes the registry walk for existing repos. The registry walk below is for the greenfield path only.
3. **If `project_kind == greenfield`**, walk the **Sub-plugin registry** in order. For each entry:
   a. Run its **install check**. If already installed, ask the user whether to re-run setup or skip.
   b. Confirm with the user before invoking the setup (especially before any step requiring elevated permissions).
   c. Invoke the **setup command** by reading and following the linked command file.
   d. Run the **post-setup verification** and report the result.
3. After all entries succeed, run the **Final-state checklist** at the bottom and report any unmet item.

Stop and ask the user before any destructive action. Never bypass a sub-plugin's own setup flow.

## Packaging model

The dev-genie marketplace currently registers five plugins: `dev-genie`,
`guardrails`, `audit`, `katana`, and `daimyo`. Marketplace plugins are pulled
from `main` and launched from their own plugin folder with no package-manager
install step managed by dev-genie. Plugins that need native or binary runtime
dependencies must own that first-run recovery in their own `bin/` launcher
(`katana` and `daimyo` do this); bundle-only plugins launch their committed
bundle directly.

The pnpm workspace packages `protocol`, `roles`, `engines`, and
`protocol-proof` are internal libraries, not installable plugins. They are
bundled into marketplace plugin `dist/` artifacts during release and must not
appear in this orchestration registry.

## Sub-plugin registry (ordered)

The order matters: guardrails must run before audit so audit takes its baseline against the scaffolded result, not against an empty repo.

### 1. guardrails

- **Purpose**: marketplace plugin for architecture scaffolds + per-stack guard rails skills.
- **Install check**: a guardrails plugin is reachable. Practical signals: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../guardrails/` exists, OR a `guardrails/` directory exists at the workspace root, OR the `/scaffold-architecture` slash command is registered. If none of these is true, instruct the user to install the `guardrails` plugin and pause.
- **Setup command**: `/scaffold-architecture <pattern>`. The pattern should be the `suggested_architecture` from project-detection if confidence is high; otherwise ask the user to choose from `react-next-vercel-webapp`, `node-api`, `supabase-api`, `supabase-node-rag`, or **skip** if the repo already has its own architecture.
- **Post-setup verification**: confirm that either (a) `eslint.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json` from the chosen architecture exist in the target dir, or (b) the user explicitly skipped scaffolding because the repo already has a chosen architecture.
- **Notes**: `/scaffold-architecture` itself invokes the `universal-guard-rails` skill at the end. Do not duplicate that here. The universal skill now asks **Q3 — Edit-time lint feedback** (offer to install a `PostToolUse` hook on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit` that runs `guardrails/scripts/lint-edited-file.sh` via `.claude/settings.json`). **Q3 defaults to "yes"**: architecture skills install `eslint_d` as a devDependency, so the hook runs through the warm daemon (~50–150ms) instead of cold-start `eslint` (~1.2s). To disable hooks at any time set `"disableAllHooks": true` in `.claude/settings.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json`); see Claude Code hooks documentation for the current disable mechanism.
- **Top-up for already-scaffolded repos**: if guardrails was scaffolded before the edit-time hook shipped, run `/guardrails-add-edit-hook` instead of re-scaffolding. It uses `dev-genie/lib/claude-settings-merger.mjs` (idempotency key: the `command` value `guardrails/scripts/lint-edited-file.sh`) to merge the hook entry into `.claude/settings.json` without touching unrelated content.

### 2. audit

- **Purpose**: marketplace plugin for composite-score scan + regression-blocking pre-commit hook.
- **Install check**: an audit plugin is reachable. Practical signals: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../audit/` exists, OR an `audit/` directory exists at the workspace root, OR the `/audit-init` slash command is registered. If `.audit/audit.config.json` already exists in the target repo, treat audit as already-baselined and confirm with the user before re-running.
- **Setup command**: `/audit-init`.
- **Post-setup verification**: confirm `.audit/audit.config.json` and `.audit/audit.results.json` exist in the target repo, and that a pre-commit hook (typically `.git/hooks/pre-commit`) was installed and runs cleanly.

### 3. katana

- **Purpose**: optional marketplace plugin for agent-driven kanban workflow that decomposes work product-doc → epic → story → task[high-pass] → task[low-pass]; ships as Claude Code plugin + MCP server + `.katana/` workspace.
- **Install check**: a katana plugin is reachable. Practical signals: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../katana/` exists, OR a `katana/` directory exists at the workspace root, OR `katana install --help` works, OR the Katana MCP server is visible in `claude mcp list`. If `.katana/` already exists in the target repo, treat katana as already-installed and confirm with the user before re-running.
- **Setup command**: `katana install <platform>` for the target agent surface, or the platform's registered Katana plugin flow. The install command must wire MCP to `node <katana plugin root>/bin/katana-mcp.js` by default, not `npx katana-mcp`.
- **Post-setup verification**: confirm `.katana/config.toml` and `.katana/vision.md` exist in the target repo, and that the katana MCP server is registered (e.g. visible in `claude mcp list`).
- **Notes**: katana is standalone-first. The greenfield walk MUST ask the user whether to install katana (it is optional; not every project wants kanban-shaped doc decomposition). Default to "no" unless project-detection signals an agent-workflow project.

### 4. daimyo

- **Purpose**: optional marketplace plugin for the out-of-process recursive govern-verify Loop supervisor. Installs the same `daimyo` artifact used standalone and by dev-genie; dev-genie may inject richer WorkSource, DecisionProvider, Validation, and notifier adapters only through Daimyo ports.
- **Install check**: a daimyo plugin is reachable. Practical signals: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../daimyo/` exists, OR a `daimyo/` directory exists at the workspace root, OR `daimyo --help` runs, OR the Daimyo MCP server is visible in `claude mcp list`. If none of these is true, instruct the user to install the `daimyo` plugin and pause.
- **Setup command**: no project mutation is required for standalone install. For a standalone markdown plan, run `daimyo run --plan <plan.md>` after confirming the selected plan and model API key environment. For dev-genie integration, instantiate Daimyo through its composition root and inject dev-genie adapters through the port options.
- **Post-setup verification**: confirm `daimyo --help` works or the Daimyo MCP server is registered, then confirm a Supervisor can be constructed from `createStandaloneDaimyo(...)` with either the default adapters or injected dev-genie adapters.
- **Notes**: daimyo depends on sibling capabilities only through port adapters. Do not import katana, guardrails, or audit from Daimyo core. If katana was installed, dev-genie can supply a katana WorkSource adapter at the composition root; Daimyo itself remains standalone with markdown/JSON WorkSource adapters.

## Adding a new sub-plugin

To extend dev-genie with a new sub-plugin (e.g. `security-review`, `test-coverage`, `doc-coverage`):

1. Append a new numbered entry to the **Sub-plugin registry** above. Choose its position carefully — entries earlier in the list run first, and any entry that consumes results from another plugin must come after it (the audit-after-guardrails rule is the canonical example).
2. Each entry must specify all four fields: **Purpose**, **Install check**, **Setup command**, **Post-setup verification**.
3. If the new plugin needs to influence the final-state checklist, add a line there too.
4. Do not introduce a separate config file or registry format. The registry is this markdown file by design — one place to edit, no parsing.

## Final-state checklist

After walking the registry (or finishing the reconciliation path), verify the project ends up with:

- [ ] guardrails skills are reachable (the user can invoke `/scaffold-architecture` and the per-architecture skill for their chosen pattern), OR the user explicitly opted out of scaffolding.
- [ ] An architecture is chosen for the project, or the user explicitly chose to skip.
- [ ] `.audit/audit.config.json` exists and contains thresholds.
- [ ] `.audit/audit.results.json` exists with a baseline scan.
- [ ] A pre-commit hook is installed and runs the audit re-scan on commit.
- [ ] Q3 (edit-time ESLint `PostToolUse` hook) was offered. If accepted, `.claude/settings.json` contains a `PostToolUse` entry whose `command` is `guardrails/scripts/lint-edited-file.sh`, and `guardrails/scripts/lint-edited-file.sh` exists in the repo. If declined or skipped, recommend `/guardrails-add-edit-hook` as the top-up.
- [ ] If katana was offered and accepted: `.katana/config.toml` and `.katana/vision.md` exist, and `claude mcp list` shows the katana MCP server.
- [ ] If katana was declined: the orchestration log records the decline and recommends `/katana-init` as a follow-up command.
- [ ] If daimyo was offered and accepted: `daimyo --help` works or `claude mcp list` shows the Daimyo MCP server, and dev-genie records whether it will use standalone markdown/JSON WorkSource or injected adapters.
- [ ] If daimyo was declined: the orchestration log records the decline and recommends installing `daimyo` before long-running autonomous Loop execution.

Additional checks for the **reconciliation path**:

- [ ] Either `eslint.config.guardrails.mjs` (layered) is present OR a managed override block is written in the user's existing eslint config.
- [ ] All agent-config locks surfaced during reconcile are resolved (skip / lift-temp / lift-perm).
- [ ] When a CI workflow is present, it runs `lint` and `typecheck`; otherwise dev-genie wrote `.github/workflows/dev-genie-guardrails.yml`.
- [ ] `.dev-genie/init.last-run.json` exists so re-runs can diff against it.

Report any unchecked item to the user with the specific follow-up command needed (e.g. "re-run `/audit-init`" or "install the `audit` plugin").
